Hello! My name is Tim, and I’d like to thank you for taking the time to review my github. I am happy to share what I’ve been learning.

I am an adult professional transitioning into cybersecurity from a  background in program management and education. I love solving complex problems and I want to stay current with technology and help in the fight against criminal and fraudulent users. I have been an active and avid user of computers, both personally and professionally, for my entire life. I have recently earned my Security+ certification and begun earnestly working with my home lab. I am also working at my Network+ and Python certifications. I feel I am ready to be a guide and counsel for others in safely shaping their digital landscapes.
